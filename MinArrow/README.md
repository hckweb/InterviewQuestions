You are given a string representing a sequence of N arrows, each pointing in one of the four cardinal directions: up ('^'), down ('v'), leff('<') or right ('>').

Write a function solution that, given a string S denoting the directions of the arrows, returns the minumum number of arrows that must be rotated to make them all point in the same directions.

Examples: 1.Given S = "^vv<v", the function should return 2. After rotating both the first ('^') and fourth ('<') arrows downwards ('v'), all of the arrows would point down.

2.Given S = "<<<" the function should return 0. All of the arrows already point left.

Assume that: - N is an integer within the range [1..100]; - string S consists only of the characters '^', 'v', '<', '>'.

In your solution, focus on correctness, the performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
